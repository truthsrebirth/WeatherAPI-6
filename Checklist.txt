Y1. our challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

2. Use the 5 Day Weather Forecast Links to an external site.to retrieve weather data for cities. 

3. The base URL should look like the following: 

     https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}

4.  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}

5. You will use localStorage to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the "Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys"(Link)

6. User Story

    AS A traveler
    I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
    SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

7. Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
    WHEN I search for a city
    THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
    WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
    WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
    WHEN I click on a city in the search history
    THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

8. Requirements:

    - Uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data
    - Uses localStorage to store persistent data
    - Deploy live URL
    - Submit Github URL


9. Before you start working with the OpenWeather API, you'll need to request an API key. To do that, visit the OpenWeather signup page and create an account.

    - truthsrebirth
    - gmail
    - ASUpikes1

    After you've created your account, if you are redirected to a page with several secondary headings (such as New Products, Services, and API Keys), click on API Keys.

    If you aren't redirected to that page, click on your username in the upper right-hand corner of the window, to display a drop-down menu. From this menu, select My API Keys.

    You'll receive a message that you can generate as many API keys as necessary for your subscription. In this case, though, you'll only need to generate one key.

    Under Create Key, give your API key a name that's unique to your project, then click the Generate button. This will take you to a page that lists any keys that you've created. They should look like a random string of 32 characters. Copy the new key that you've created, and save it in the JavaScript file where you'll be making API calls.

        Key name: API-Key-Weather6
        Key: 00b302d41546917b937056b9a6f40975
